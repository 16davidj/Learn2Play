\f0\fs24 \cf0 This application, Learn2Play, was created as a part of UC Irvine's COSMOS research program. It uses an programming environment for audio called PureData, or Pd, to synthesize sounds that simulate those of a Piano, Violin, and Guitar. The application was created for the use of an iPad Mini. Some of the program's functions may be deprecated, as most of the coding was done with Xcode 6 and Swift 1.0. The   purpose of the app was to create a Guitar Hero-like experience, with color-coded notes that flash green when the note is played correctly and red if incorrectly. Basic songs include: Mary Had a Little Lamb, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and Hot Cross Buns. Freestyle mode is also available.}
